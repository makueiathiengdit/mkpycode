 <h1> Welcome to Ramchiel Robotics </h1>

 <p> Ramchiel Robotics was established in Feb 2017 by Team Manager Kuc Mayur Kuc, Team Engineer Richard Ring Kuach Malek, and Samuel Garang Akau of the University of Juba, School of Public Service And outh Empowerment Network South Sudan with an enthusaiasm to move and urge South sudanese youth to embrace and study Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), and enable them to develop their talent and inovation to think in solving real-world problems in the areas of agriculture, energy and more. </p>
<p> Team has much desire for the future of the new nation to be shown in the progression of science and innovation as a tool for solving their critical problems such as conflicts, food insecurity, water and healthcare amog others.</p>

<p>Team South Sudan appreciates <i>First Global</i> for giving a rare tremendous opportunity and logistics support to its team members to participate in the <i> First Global Challenge</i> in July 207, Washington Dc, USA.  </p>

<p>South Sudan Robotic Team was awarded gold medal for courageous acheievement, recognizing the challenges the team faced in building the robot. </p>

<p>The aim is to mobilize and encourage South Sudanes youth fromage of <b>18 years</b> and below to join and participate in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), innovation and creativity.   </p>

<p>The skills acquired through STEM will be applied in the development our country.  </p>

<p>The use of technology suc as energy, boosts the production and development of various fields. Currently most the population uses generators as the source of energy instead of using hydropower or renewable energy such as solar power, which would help us fight environmental pollution caused by use of diesel and fuel.</p>
